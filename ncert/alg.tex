\item Let X represent the difference between the number of heads and the number of
tails obtained when a coin is tossed 6 times. What are possible values of X?
 \item If each element of a $2\times 2$ determinant is either zero or one. What is the probability that the value of the determinant is positive ? 
 (Assume that the individual entries of the determinant are chosen independently each value being assumed with probability $\frac{1}{2}$) \\
